1. `ls -F`  to not only list the directories within the current directory, but to also label which ones are files and which ones are folders(using color code).
		- / indicates a directory
		- @ : link
		- * indicates an executable
2. `ls -l` also prints the author of each file
3. `ls -l [FILENAME/DIRECTORY NAME]`  lists the files in the required directory

4. the `alias` command: some commands are really hard to type, especially when they are going to be used again and again, and the directory names are considerably long. In that case, the `alias` command gives you a shortcut
		- `alias (alias name) "command_name"`
		- unaliasing `unalias [alias name]`
		- `alias-p` option prints all the defined aliases
